# Probabilistic Simulation of a Client-Server System
A program that does a probabilistic simulation of a client server system. The clients generate job packages at random times and place them on the global queue. Every package takes a random amount of time to execute and if the servers are busy the package stays on the queue. At every time interval the client and the server are woken up to simulate work done during this interval. Program utilizes the use of P-threads in C.
